	## Part 1 Lab Preparation

### Get the latest content:
As always, pull updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub to both your Pi and your own GitHub repo. As we discussed in the class, there are 2 ways you can do so:


Option 1: On the Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub`, pull the updates from upstream (class lab-hub) and push the updates back to your own GitHub repo. You will need the personal access token for this.
```
pi@ixe00:~$ cd Interactive-Lab-Hub
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git pull upstream Fall2025
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git add .
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git commit -m "get lab4 content"
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git push
```

Option 2: On your own GitHub repo, [create pull request](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md) to get updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub. After you have latest updates online, go on your Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub` and use `git pull` to get updates from your own GitHub repo.

Option 3: (preferred) use the Github.com interface to update the changes.

## Lab Overview
Collaborators: Jessica Hsiao (dj779), Irene Wu (yw2785)

For lab this week, we focus both on sensing, to bring in new modes of input into your devices, as well as prototyping the physical look and feel of the device. You will think about the physical form the device needs to perform the sensing as well as present the display or feedback about what was sensed. 


A) [Capacitive Sensing](#part-a)

B) [OLED screen](#part-b) 

C) [Paper Display](#part-c)

D) [Materiality](#part-d)

E) [Servo Control](#part-e)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f)


## The Report (Part 1: A-D, Part 2: E-F)

### Quick Start: Python Environment Setup

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment in Lab 4:**
	```bash
	cd ~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab\ 4
	python3 -m venv .venv
	source .venv/bin/activate
	```
2. **Install all Lab 4 requirements:**
	```bash
	pip install -r requirements2025.txt
	```
3. **Check CircuitPython Blinka installation:**
	```bash
	python blinkatest.py
	```
	If you see "Hello blinka!", your setup is correct. If not, follow the troubleshooting steps in the file or ask for help.

### Part A
### Capacitive Sensing, a.k.a. Human-Twizzler Interaction 

We want to introduce you to the [capacitive sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mpr121-gator) in your kit. It's one of the most flexible input devices we are able to provide. At boot, it measures the capacitance on each of the 12 contacts. Whenever that capacitance changes, it considers it a user touch. You can attach any conductive material. In your kit, you have copper tape that will work well, but don't limit yourself! In the example below, we use Twizzlers--you should pick your own objects.


<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/guides/cropped_images/000/003/226/medium640/MPR121_top_angle.jpg?1609282424" height="150" />
 
</p>

Plug in the capacitive sensor board with the QWIIC connector. Connect your Twizzlers with either the copper tape or the alligator clips (the clips work better). Install the latest requirements from your working virtual environment:

These Twizzlers are connected to pads 6 and 10. When you run the code and touch a Twizzler, the terminal will print out the following

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python cap_test.py 
Twizzler 10 touched!
Twizzler 6 touched!
```

### Part B
### More sensors

#### Light/Proximity/Gesture sensor (APDS-9960)

We here want you to get to know this awesome sensor [Adafruit APDS-9960](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3595). It is capable of sensing proximity, light (also RGB), and gesture! 
 
<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3595-06.jpg" width=200>
 

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector and try running the three example scripts individually to see what the sensor is capable of doing!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python proximity_test.py
...
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python gesture_test.py
...
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python color_test.py
...
```

You can go the the [Adafruit GitHub Page](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_APDS9960) to see more examples for this sensor!

#### Rotary Encoder 

A rotary encoder is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position to analog or digital output signals. The [Adafruit rotary encoder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991#technical-details) we ordered for you came with separate breakout board and encoder itself, that is, they will need to be soldered if you have not yet done so! We will be bringing the soldering station to the lab class for you to use, also, you can go to the MakerLAB to do the soldering off-class. Here is some [guidance on soldering](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/preparation) from Adafruit. When you first solder, get someone who has done it before (ideally in the MakerLAB environment). It is a good idea to review this material beforehand so you know what to look at.

### Part C
### Physical considerations for sensing


Usually, sensors need to be positioned in specific locations or orientations to make them useful for their application. Now that you've tried a bunch of the sensors, pick one that you would like to use, and an application where you use the output of that sensor for an interaction. For example, you can use a distance sensor to measure someone's height if you position it overhead and get them to stand under it. 

We chose **Light/Proximity/Gesture sensor (APDS-9960)** as our sensor.

**Application #1: Plant Health Monitor**

- Sensor information: light
- The device is capable of detecting plant color variations by RGB. When the color shifts from bright and vibrant tones to brown, the system alerts users that the plants are under stress or nearing death. Users can then respond by providing additional water or nutrients to restore plant health.

**Application #2: Natural Lighting Room**

- Sensor information: light
- Mounted near a window or ceiling fixture, the sensor continuously measures ambient light intensity. When sufficient natural light is detected, the system automatically dims or turns off artificial lighting to save energy.

**Application #3:  Exhibition Visitor Counter**

- Sensor information: gesture
- Placed on a side or above an exhibit entryway, the APDS-9960 detects directional hand or body movements. When a visitor passes by, the gesture data (e.g., left or right swipe) increments a counter, helping curators estimate visitor flow and engagement.

**Application #4: Eye Wellness Assistant**

- Sensor information: proximity
- Integrated near a computer monitor or laptop bezel, the proximity sensor tracks how close a user’s face is to the screen. If the user sits too close for prolonged periods, the system gently alerts them to maintain a healthier viewing distance.

**Application #5: Movie Controller**

- Sensor information: gesture
- Installed near a TV or projector, the sensor enables touch-free gesture controls. Users can swipe left to rewind, swipe right to skip, or perform an upward gesture to pause/play the movie.



**\*\*\*Draw 5 sketches of different ways you might use your sensor, and how the larger device needs to be shaped in order to make the sensor useful.\*\*\***

Application #1: Plant Health Monitor

Application #2: Natural Lighting Room

Application #3:  Exhibition Visitor Counter

Application #4: Eye Wellness Assistant

Application #5: Movie Controller


**\*\*\*What are some things these sketches raise as questions? What do you need to physically prototype to understand how to anwer those questions?\*\*\***

**Application #1: Plant Health Monitor**
- Questions raised:
	1. Connection and communication: The sketch doesn’t specify how the sensor and the display communicate — whether they are connected by wire, use wireless transmission, or operate through an intermediary microcontroller such as a Raspberry Pi.
	2. Sensor placement: It’s unclear how the sensor should be positioned or angled relative to the plant’s leaves to ensure consistent and accurate color readings.
	3. Environmental lighting effects: Different ambient lighting conditions (sunny vs. cloudy, indoor vs. outdoor) could alter the perceived color of the plant, even when its actual health remains the same.

- To address these questions, we can first build a prototype that tests various sensor positions and angles to determine which setup yields the most stable readings. Next, running lighting variation tests — capturing RGB data under multiple environmental conditions — would help calibrate thresholds or develop compensation algorithms. Finally, prototyping the communication pathway between the sensor and display (wired vs. wireless) will clarify how to make the system responsive and portable for real-world use.

**Application #2: Natural Lighting Room**

- Questions raised:
	1. Light differentiation: The sketch doesn’t explain how the sensor distinguishes between natural and artificial light — will it rely solely on overall brightness, or also consider color temperature and spectral balance?
	2. Sensitivity and stability: It’s unclear how sensitive the system should be before adjusting lighting intensity. Minor fluctuations in sunlight (e.g., when clouds pass) could cause unstable dimming or flickering.
	3. Sensor orientation: The sensor’s placement and angle might significantly affect readings — pointing it directly at a window versus facing the interior ceiling could produce very different results.
	4. Communication and control: The sketch doesn’t specify how the sensor interacts with the lighting system — through direct wiring, a microcontroller, or a wireless connection.

- To address these questions, we can start by testing the sensor at different positions and orientations within a room to measure how light readings vary across the day. Next, a calibration experiment can help determine appropriate brightness thresholds and smoothing algorithms to avoid frequent or erratic lighting changes. Finally, building a prototype connection between the sensor and a light controller (e.g., Raspberry Pi + LED dimmer) will allow us to evaluate real-time response and communication reliability.

**Application #3:  Exhibition Visitor Counter**

- Questions raised:
	1. Detection accuracy: The sketch doesn’t specify how the sensor distinguishes between individual visitors — for example, how it avoids counting the same person twice or missing people walking closely together.
	2. Range and directionality: It’s unclear how far the APDS-9960 can reliably detect gestures or movement and whether it can sense entry versus exit directions.
	3. Environmental interference: Exhibition lighting, reflections, or nearby displays might interfere with gesture detection or falsely trigger the counter.
	4. Physical placement: The optimal height and orientation of the sensor relative to the doorway are uncertain — it may need to be tested at various positions to ensure consistent detection.

- By testing different sensor heights and distances near an actual doorway, we can measure detection accuracy for varying visitor speeds and group sizes. Additionally, running environmental tests under different lighting conditions will help determine if shielding or calibration is needed to reduce false triggers. Finally, prototyping a count display system will help evaluate real-time feedback and timing consistency during high-traffic scenarios.

**Application #4: Eye Wellness Assistant**

- Questions raised:
	1. Unclear sense of distance: The sketch doesn’t convey how far the user is from the screen, making it difficult to judge whether the sensor can accurately measure a comfortable viewing range.
	2. Screen tilt impact: The monitor’s tilt angle could affect proximity readings, since the sensor’s detection depends heavily on its facing direction.
	3. Sensor form and placement: The drawing doesn’t indicate the sensor’s actual size or visibility, leaving uncertainty about whether it would distract the user or blend seamlessly into the screen design.

- To answer the first question, we need to design a way to display the distance information to the user, for instance, putting a tiny monitor next to the screen to show the number. For the second and the third questions, they can be approached by conducting user studies with the physical prototype to experiment in a real-world settings. We can run user trials with different sensor placements and screen angles to evaluate accuracy, comfort, and intrusiveness in daily use.

**Application #5: Movie Controller**

- Questions raised:
	1. Gesture recognition accuracy: The sketch doesn’t clarify how reliably the sensor can differentiate between gestures such as left, right, or up swipes, especially when users vary in hand speed or distance.
	2. Detection range and angle: It’s unclear how far the user can sit from the screen while still being detected, or how wide the sensor’s field of view needs to be to capture gestures effectively.
	3. Interference and usability: Ambient lighting, reflections, or nearby movement (like someone walking past) could accidentally trigger commands. The sketch doesn’t show how the system might prevent or handle such false positives.

- To address these questions, we can build a functional prototype that connects the gesture sensor to a simple media controller. This would allow testing of gesture detection accuracy across multiple users, distances, and lighting conditions. We also need to experiment with sensor placement and viewing angles — for example, mounting it on top of or below the TV — to find the most reliable setup. Lastly, collecting real interaction data can help define gesture thresholds and filtering strategies to minimize unintended activations.


**\*\*\*Pick one of these designs to prototype.\*\*\***

We picked the forth one to prototype: Eye Wellness Assistant


### Part D
### Physical considerations for displaying information and housing parts

<details>
	<summary>Examples (Click to expand)
	</summary>
	Here is a Pi with a paper faceplate on it to turn it into a display interface:


<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/paper_if.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>


This is fine, but the mounting of the display constrains the display location and orientation a lot. Also, it really only works for applications where people can come and stand over the Pi, or where you can mount the Pi to the wall.

Here is another prototype for a paper display:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/b_box.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>


Your kit includes these [SparkFun Qwiic OLED screens](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17153). These use less power than the MiniTFTs you have mounted on the GPIO pins of the Pi, but, more importantly, they can be more flexibly mounted elsewhere on your physical interface. The way you program this display is almost identical to the way you program a  Pi display. Take a look at `oled_test.py` and some more of the [Adafruit examples](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SSD1306/tree/master/examples).

<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/6/1/3/5/17153-SparkFun_Qwiic_OLED_Display__0.91_in__128x32_-01.jpg" height="200" />

</p>


It holds a Pi and usb power supply, and provides a front stage on which to put writing, graphics, LEDs, buttons or displays.

This design can be made by scoring a long strip of corrugated cardboard of width X, with the following measurements:

| Y height of box <br> <sub><sup>- thickness of cardboard</sup></sub> | Z  depth of box <br><sub><sup>- thickness of cardboard</sup></sub> | Y height of box  | Z  depth of box | H height of faceplate <br><sub><sup>* * * * * (don't make this too short) * * * * *</sup></sub>|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 

Fold the first flap of the strip so that it sits flush against the back of the face plate, and tape, velcro or hot glue it in place. This will make a H x X interface, with a box of Z x X footprint (which you can adapt to the things you want to put in the box) and a height Y in the back. 

Here is an example:

</details>



Think about how you want to present the information about what your sensor is sensing! Design a paper display for your project that communicates the state of the Pi and a sensor. Ideally you should design it so that you can slide the Pi out to work on the circuit or programming, and then slide it back in and reattach a few wires to be back in operation.
 
**\*\*\*Sketch 5 designs for how you would physically position your display and any buttons or knobs needed to interact with it.\*\*\***

**Design #1**: The physical prototype includes an adjustable sensor holder extending from the computer, with a small board placed next to it for sensor integration. When the user is too close to the monitor, the board will display a red light and flash continuously to alert them. Otherwise, the board will remain black without providing any additional notifications.

**Design #2**: The physical prototype includes an adjustable curved phone stand extending from the computer, with a small light placed beside it to indicate the proximity detection status. It uses a color light (green = good, yellow =  a bit close, red = too close) to present the status.


**Design #3**: The physical prototype includes an adjustable curved phone stand extending from the computer, with a small board placed next to it for sensor integration. The actual distance between the screen and the user’s face will be displayed on the board.

**Design #4**: Place the sensor on top of the computer with the sensor facing downward. When the user gets too close to the computer (meaning their head is below the sensor), the sensor detects the proximity and uses a beeping sound to alert the users.

**Design #5**: Place the sensor on top of the computer with the sensor facing downward. When the user gets too close to the computer (meaning their head is below the sensor), a voice message will be played to remind the user of the distance, such as “you are too close to your screen, please keep away from it”



**\*\*\*What are some things these sketches raise as questions? What do you need to physically prototype to understand how to anwer those questions?\*\*\***

#### Design #1

- Questions raised:
	1. How sensitive should the proximity threshold be to accurately detect when the user is “too close” without triggering false alerts?
	2. Will the flashing red light be noticeable yet comfortable for the user, or could it become distracting during long use?
	3. How much does the adjustable sensor angle affect detection accuracy across different screen tilt positions and user heights?
- What to prototype:
	1. Test various distance thresholds to determine the optimal trigger range for comfort and accuracy.
	2. Experiment with different light intensities, colors, and flashing rates to find a balance between visibility and user comfort.
	3. Build and evaluate the adjustable holder to measure how sensor angle and placement influence proximity detection reliability.


#### Design #2

- Questions raised:
	1. What are the optimal distance thresholds for each color indicator (green, yellow, red) to provide meaningful and intuitive feedback to users?
	2. Will users easily notice and interpret the color changes, or would additional feedback (e.g., brightness or flashing) improve clarity?
	3. How does the curved stand’s angle and height affect the accuracy of proximity detection for users of different sitting positions?
- What to prototype:
	1. Calibrate and test various distance ranges to define clear and consistent thresholds for each light color.
	2. Conduct short user tests to evaluate whether color feedback alone is sufficient for awareness and comfort.
	3. Build the curved stand prototype and measure detection performance at multiple sensor angles and user heights to ensure reliability.


#### Design #3

- Questions raised:
	1. How accurate and responsive will the displayed distance values be when the user moves slightly or changes posture?
	2. What is the most effective way to display the distance information so that it’s noticeable without being distracting?
	3. How does the sensor’s placement or tilt angle influence measurement consistency across different screen setups and user positions?
- What to prototype:
	1. Test the sensor’s real-time distance measurement accuracy and response speed under typical usage movements.
	2. Experiment with different display formats (numerical, graphical, or color-coded) to assess readability and user comfort.
	3. Build the adjustable stand prototype and measure how various angles and distances affect data stability and reliability.

#### Design #4:

- Questions raised:
	1. How accurately can the downward-facing sensor detect when the user’s head crosses the threshold distance without being affected by lighting or hair color?
	2. What should the distance threshold be to ensure the alert triggers at a comfortable and safe viewing distance?
	3. Will the beeping alert remain effective over time, or might it become annoying or easy to ignore during long computer use?
- What to prototype:
	1. Test detection reliability across users with different heights, hairstyles, and seating positions.
	2. Experiment with several threshold distances to determine an optimal range that balances comfort and alert sensitivity.
	3. Prototype different audio feedback patterns (e.g., single beep vs. continuous tone) to evaluate which is most noticeable yet least disruptive.


#### Design #5:
- Questions raised:
	1. How should the timing and frequency of the voice alert be set so it effectively reminds users without feeling intrusive?
	2. Will the downward-facing sensor maintain consistent accuracy across users with different heights and seating distances?
	3. Do users perceive the voice message as helpful feedback or as a distraction during focused work?
- What to prototype:
	1. Experiment with various voice alert intervals, tones, and volumes to find a balance between clarity and comfort.
	2. Test the sensor’s performance across diverse user positions and lighting environments to ensure reliable detection.
	3. Conduct short user evaluations comparing voice feedback with other alert methods (e.g., light or sound) to determine the most preferred design.

# LAB PART 2

### Part 2

Following exploration and reflection from Part 1, complete the "looks like," "works like" and "acts like" prototypes for your design, reiterated below.



### Part E

#### Chaining Devices and Exploring Interaction Effects

For Part 2, you will design and build a fun interactive prototype using multiple inputs and outputs. This means chaining Qwiic and STEMMA QT devices (e.g., buttons, encoders, sensors, servos, displays) and/or combining with traditional breadboard prototyping (e.g., LEDs, buzzers, etc.).

**Your prototype should:**
- Combine at least two different types of input and output devices, inspired by your physical considerations from Part 1.
- Be playful, creative, and demonstrate multi-input/multi-output interaction.

**Document your system with:**
- Code for your multi-device demo
- Photos and/or video of the working prototype in action
- A simple interaction diagram or sketch showing how inputs and outputs are connected and interact
- Written reflection: What did you learn about multi-input/multi-output interaction? What was fun, surprising, or challenging?

**Questions to consider:**
- What new types of interaction become possible when you combine two or more sensors or actuators?
- How does the physical arrangement of devices (e.g., where the encoder or sensor is placed) change the user experience?
- What happens if you use one device to control or modulate another (e.g., encoder sets a threshold, sensor triggers an action)?
- How does the system feel if you swap which device is "primary" and which is "secondary"?

Try chaining different combinations and document what you discover!

See encoder_accel_servo_dashboard.py in the Lab 4 folder for an example of chaining together three devices.

**`Lab 4/encoder_accel_servo_dashboard.py`**

#### Using Multiple Qwiic Buttons: Changing I2C Address (Physically & Digitally)

If you want to use more than one Qwiic Button in your project, you must give each button a unique I2C address. There are two ways to do this:

##### 1. Physically: Soldering Address Jumpers

On the back of the Qwiic Button, you'll find four solder jumpers labeled A0, A1, A2, and A3. By bridging these with solder, you change the I2C address. Only one button on the chain can use the default address (0x6F).

**Address Table:**

| A3 | A2 | A1 | A0 | Address (hex) |
|----|----|----|----|---------------|
|  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |    0x6F       |
|  0 |  0 |  0 |  1 |    0x6E       |
|  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |    0x6D       |
|  0 |  0 |  1 |  1 |    0x6C       |
|  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |    0x6B       |
|  0 |  1 |  0 |  1 |    0x6A       |
|  0 |  1 |  1 |  0 |    0x69       |
|  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |    0x68       |
|  1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |    0x67       |
| ...| ...| ...| ... |     ...      |

For example, if you solder A0 closed (leave A1, A2, A3 open), the address becomes 0x6E.

**Soldering Tips:**
- Use a small amount of solder to bridge the pads for the jumper you want to close.
- Only one jumper needs to be closed for each address change (see table above).
- Power cycle the button after changing the jumper.

##### 2. Digitally: Using Software to Change Address

You can also change the address in software (temporarily or permanently) using the example script `qwiic_button_ex6_changeI2CAddress.py` in the Lab 4 folder. This is useful if you want to reassign addresses without soldering.

Run the script and follow the prompts:
```bash
python qwiic_button_ex6_changeI2CAddress.py
```
Enter the new address (e.g., 5B for 0x5B) when prompted. Power cycle the button after changing the address.

**Note:** The software method is less foolproof and you need to make sure to keep track of which button has which address!


##### Using Multiple Buttons in Code

After setting unique addresses, you can use multiple buttons in your script. See these example scripts in the Lab 4 folder:

- **`qwiic_1_button.py`**: Basic example for reading a single Qwiic Button (default address 0x6F). Run with:
	```bash
	python qwiic_1_button.py
	```

- **`qwiic_button_led_demo.py`**: Demonstrates using two Qwiic Buttons at different addresses (e.g., 0x6F and 0x6E) and controlling their LEDs. Button 1 toggles its own LED; Button 2 toggles both LEDs. Run with:
	```bash
	python qwiic_button_led_demo.py
	```

Here is a minimal code example for two buttons:
```python
import qwiic_button

# Default button (0x6F)
button1 = qwiic_button.QwiicButton()
# Button with A0 soldered (0x6E)
button2 = qwiic_button.QwiicButton(0x6E)

button1.begin()
button2.begin()

while True:
		if button1.is_button_pressed():
				print("Button 1 pressed!")
		if button2.is_button_pressed():
				print("Button 2 pressed!")
```

### PCF8574 GPIO Expander: Add More Pins Over I²C

Sometimes your Pi’s header GPIO pins are already full (e.g., with a display or HAT). That’s where an I²C GPIO expander comes in handy.

We use the Adafruit PCF8574 I²C GPIO Expander, which gives you 8 extra digital pins over I²C. It’s a great way to prototype with LEDs, buttons, or other components on the breadboard without worrying about pin conflicts—similar to how Arduino users often expand their pinouts when prototyping physical interactions.

**Why is this useful?**
- You only need two wires (I²C: SDA + SCL) to unlock 8 extra GPIOs.
- It integrates smoothly with CircuitPython and Blinka.
- It allows a clean prototyping workflow when the Pi’s 40-pin header is already occupied by displays, HATs, or sensors.
- Makes breadboard setups feel more like an Arduino-style prototyping environment where it’s easy to wire up interaction elements.

**Demo Script:** `Lab 4/gpio_expander.py`

</p>

We connected 8 LEDs (through 220 Ω resistors) to the expander and ran a little light show. The script cycles through three patterns:
- Chase (one LED at a time, left to right)
- Knight Rider (back-and-forth sweep)
- Disco (random blink chaos)

Every few runs, the script swaps to the next pattern automatically:
```bash
python gpio_expander.py
```

This is a playful way to visualize how the expander works, but the same technique applies if you wanted to prototype buttons, switches, or other interaction elements. It’s a lightweight, flexible addition to your prototyping toolkit.

### Servo Control with SparkFun Servo pHAT
For this lab, you will use the **SparkFun Servo pHAT** to control a micro servo (such as the Miuzei MS18 or similar 9g servo). The Servo pHAT stacks directly on top of the Adafruit Mini PiTFT (135×240) display without pin conflicts:
- The Mini PiTFT uses SPI (GPIO22, 23, 24, 25) for display and buttons ([SPI pinout](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/spi)).
- The Servo pHAT uses I²C (GPIO2 & 3) for the PCA9685 servo driver ([I2C pinout](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/i2c)).
- Since SPI and I²C are separate buses, you can use both boards together.
**⚡ Power:**
- Plug a USB-C cable into the Servo pHAT to provide enough current for the servos. The Pi itself should still be powered by its own USB-C supply. Do NOT power servos from the Pi’s 5V rail.

</p>

**Basic Python Example:**
We provide a simple example script: `Lab 4/pi_servo_hat_test.py` (requires the `pi_servo_hat` Python package).
Run the example:
```
python pi_servo_hat_test.py
```
For more details and advanced usage, see the [official SparkFun Servo pHAT documentation](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pi-servo-phat-v2-hookup-guide/all#resources-and-going-further).
A servo motor is a rotary actuator that allows for precise control of angular position. The position is set by the width of an electrical pulse (PWM). You can read [this Adafruit guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-14-servo-motors/servo-motors) to learn more about how servos work.
